			<h3> The Beginning </h3>
				<img src="images/oned2.jpg" alt="One Direction" class="floatr">
				<p> The group formed in 2010 on the British television show The X Factor, a talent contest for aspiring singers. Each of the five members auditioned and originally competed as a solo performer, but early in the season they were advised to pool their talents. Taking the name One Direction, the boys—all were between 16 and 18 years old at the time—attracted substantial attention, especially from young female viewers, for their charismatic stage presence and vocal skills. Although One Direction ultimately fell short of winning on The X Factor, the show’s mastermind, Simon Cowell, offered the act a recording contract soon after the season ended. </p>

			<h3> The First Album </h3>
				<img src="images/oned4.jpg" alt="One Direction" class="floatl">
				<p> In the tradition of earlier pop-music “boy bands,” One Direction was promoted as a set of teen idols who were musically compatible but also distinct in style and personality. After building its fan base in early 2011 by touring the British Isles with fellow The X Factor contestants, the group entered the recording studio. The resulting album, Up All Night (2011), filled with cheerily harmonized pop songs about carefree revelry, first-time heartbreak, and other adolescent concerns, was an immediate hit both at home and in other European and Commonwealth countries. Its popularity was fueled in part by the song “What Makes You Beautiful,” a buoyant empowerment anthem that topped the British and Irish singles charts and in early 2012 was named best British single at the Brit Awards (the British equivalent of the Grammy Awards). </p>

				<p>One Direction achieved third place in the competition and immediately after the final, their song "Forever Young", which would have been released if they had won The X Factor, was leaked onto the internet. Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported £2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with RedOne, a record producer. A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was published by HarperCollins in February 2011, subsequently topping The Sunday Times Best Seller list. The same month, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. </p>

			<h3> Popularity </h3>
				<img src="images/oned5.jpg" alt="One Direction" class="floatr">
				<p> Although the American market had often bedeviled otherwise popular British boy bands, One Direction, aided by a social media campaign that introduced the group to potential overseas fans, had little difficulty breaking through. Up All Night debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart upon its 2012 release and went on to sell more than a million copies in the United States. The quintet extended its worldwide success with its sophomore release, Take Me Home (2012), which departed little from the winning formula of its predecessor. In 2013 the group was the subject of a 3-D concert-tour documentary, One Direction: This Is Us, and released a third hit album, Midnight Memories. Two years later, while touring in support of the album Four (2014), One Direction announced that Malik had left the group. The remaining four continued to tour but announced a planned hiatus shortly before the release of Made in the A.M. (2015), and the band members began issuing solo albums thereafter. </p>
				<img src="images/oned6.jpg" alt="One Direction" class="floatr">
				<p>On 13 January 2016, Us Weekly published a report claiming that the group's hiatus would become a permanent split, with a "source" citing that each of the four remaining group members did not renew their contracts following the completion of the On The Road Again Tour in October 2015. Representatives for the group denied said-report in a statement to Billboard, stating, "nothing has changed regarding hiatus plans for the group, and all will be revealed in due time from the band members' own mouths." By May 2017, all members of the group had released solo singles. Despite saying the hiatus would last 18 months, the band still are yet to confirm when they will reform.</p>
